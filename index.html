      To be relentless is to never settle. It means scrutinising over every detail and repeating the work over and over again
      incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to be relentless you have to be willing to take chances. We canâ€™t gain anything without sacrifice and must
      get comfortable being uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A relentless human being also will never celebrate their achievements. Instead, they look forward to their next goal and
      start working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Done, next.
